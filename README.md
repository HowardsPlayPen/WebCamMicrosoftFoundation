This code was downloaded from  https://elcharolin.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/webcam-capture-with-the-media-foundation-sdk/

and was a good introduction to accessing Webcams using Microsoft Foundation api calls but it contained a number of nasty issues that caught me out. 

So I thought I would update and annotate the code to show what I found.

This first commit is the base code as was downloaded - ie. prior to any updates and annotations.
